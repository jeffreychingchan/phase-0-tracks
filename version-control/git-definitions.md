# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

	version control manage all the different versions and compile into a final version 

	version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. 

	it will have a time line to show all the version and who edited it and when they edited it 


-----------------------------------------------------

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

	gives you a "copy" of your project to work on.

	when working with multiple people, its important to have branches 

	want to keepy master clean unedited and clean

------------------------------------------------------


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

	commit is like a save point in your project. 

	a good commit message is a detailed description on what's added into the file. 

-----------------------------------------------------



* What is a merge conflict?

	A merge conflict usually occurs when your current branch and the branch you want to merge into the current branch have diverged.
 
	The merge conflicts occur when there are disagreeing changes

	Example: if two people changed the same lines in that same file, or if one person decided to delete it while the other person decided to modify it, merge conflicts will occur.
