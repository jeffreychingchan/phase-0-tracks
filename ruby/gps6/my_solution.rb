# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [with: ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# require_relative is used to load local file data.
# Require is a builtin method. require_relative is a compliment to allow you load another ruby file. require_relative is used more for locally self-contained related files. Require is used more frequently to get data from a solid source or database. Require_relative requires a specific path to a local file.
require_relative 'state_data'

class VirusPredictor

# default method to assign state to new instances of VirusPredictor. Contains 3 parameters.
  def initialize(state_of_origin, population_density, population)
    @state = state_of_origin
    @population = population
    @population_density = population_density
  end

# calls two other methods with 3 a and 2 rguments respectively.

    predicted_deaths
    speed_of_spread

    # by additional factors we haven't added into this functionality.

# Reflection Section

What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
# If it's a hash in a hash, the second hash is set with a =>. the first hash is set with = {}.
What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
# require_relative requires a local file from the related folder. require is less restrictive for access.
What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
# use .each method. You can get the value by using hash[keyname]
When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
# the parameters are unnecessary because we only need the instance variables.
What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
# you can a call value in a loop by calling the hash with the key name.
