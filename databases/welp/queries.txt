2 You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?


sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews 
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses on reviews.business_id = businesses.id 
   ...> INNER JOIN users on reviews.user_id = users.id;


1|5|GREAT PASTA!|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|Brandfor|Pitt
2|2|the food was ok|3|5|3|The Beagle Nightclub|5|Holly|Berry
3|1|i rather eat at micky D!|2|3|2|Amir's Towing|3|Angela|Jolie


============================================

3 There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.


sqlite> SELECT users.First_name, users.Last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name 
   ...> FROM reviews 
   ...> JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

4 How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews 
   ...> INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   ...> WHERE name = "Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel";
